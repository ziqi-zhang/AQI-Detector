# AQI-Detector
A simple AQI detector based on sky images. 

I use SVM to predict AQI value and grab-cut to segment sky in the picture.
The training image data is from 北京一目了然公众环境保护研究中心(https://weibo.com/u/1000481815?topnav=1&wvr=6&topsug=1&is_hot=1) and thanks for their kindness. Due to copyright concern I didn't put training image data here.
